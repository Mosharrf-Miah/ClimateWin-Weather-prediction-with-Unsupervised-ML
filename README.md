# ClimateWin Weather Predictions With Optimised Unsupervised ML

## Project Summary
ClimateWin are a non-profit organisaation based in Europe. With the use of optimised Machine learning models they are looking to better predicted weather trends around Europe, as well as weather conditions which might deviate from the norm.

## Key Questions

1. Can we identify Weather conditions which deviate from the norm?

2. Can we use the current climate trends to predict future weather conditions?

3. What are the effects of climate change on the future and can it be changed?



## Data 

18 weather stations across Europe. The weather stations have been collecting data from the late 1800s to 2022. The dataset includes daily values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation.
The below addition data is also required 

1. Radar Imaginary
2. Extreme Weather
3. Real Time Weather Conditions


## Tools
1. Python
   - CNN
   - GAN
   - Random Forest
3. Powerpoint
